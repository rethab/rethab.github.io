Earlier this year, after three years, ten months, two weeks, and three days after having created my [Todoist](https://todoist.com) account, I reached the Enlightened status, which is the highest level you can reach in Todoist's gamification system.
According to Todoist, only 0.05% of their users reach this status.

I have been described as "productive" or "structured" by my peers. While I don't think I'm as "productive" or "structured" as some might think, I still believe todoist helps a lot with organizing everyday tasks.

In this post, I'm going to describe how I use Todoist as well as some general tips on productivity.

## Writing Things Down Frees Your Mind

A few years ago, I read this book called [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done).
I don't remember much, but one thing stuck with me:
Imagine you need to mail an important letter tomorrow.
This might prevent you from falling asleep easily, because you keep thinking about what would happen if you forgot to mail it.

In these situations, I always add a task to Todoist and set a reminder for when I need to do it.
This helps me free my mind and focus on something more important -- or nothing at all, when I'd like to fall asleep.

## Stick With One Tool

Are you following [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)? [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)? 
There's a new tool for keeping tasks almost every day.
And there are people who keep trying them and blame the tool for why they're not happy with their productivity.

I am pretty sure the tool is most often not the problem.

I mean, it's probably exciting to try something new, but you have to understand that switching the tool you're using comes with a cost as well.
And if your problem is not being able to get tasks done, then the next tool will not help with that.

Todoist is pretty simple.
At least on the surface, it's really just a piece of software that lets you create a task and set a due date.
You don't really need more, but what you do need is persistence:
Focus on using one tool and stick with it.
It might not be perfect, but the next one won't be perfect either, and then you lose all the time switching.

## Groom Your Inbox

Todoist comes with several views.
The one I use most often is "Today".
These are the tasks I want to finish today.
Another one is the "Inbox".
Those are the tasks without a date.

In terms of tasks that land in the Inbox, because they miss a date, I have decided for myself that that's a red flag.
There is no task that has no due date.
There might be a task that is not important, but even that task probably needs to be done by a certain date.

Therefore, about once per month, I scroll through my Inbox and make sure every task has a date.
Sometimes, I would see a task where I actually forgot to set a date, and I'd fix that.
However, what happens more often is that there are things in my Inbox, which are not really tasks, but rather just some notes.
I move those to the respective project, but more on that below.

## Collect Notes In Projects

I don't just use Todoist for things I need to do.
I also use it to collect articles I'd like to read, recipes I'd like to try, things I'd like to do, etc.

I have a feeling I never actually do most of these things.
But I believe it's great for productivity, because I often find myself scrolling through hackernews and finding all sorts of articles that are very interesting to read.
That is often procrastination, though.
I have found that by storing those articles in Todoist and coming back to them when I actually have time, that fancy article about new technology xzy often doesn't seem all that appealing anymore.

## Add Tags For People

In my daily life, just like at work, I come across things I want to ask someone else.
When that happens, I create a task and tag it with the person.
As soon as I meet the person, I can just pull up Todoist and search by task.

For example, I meet my account about once in six months.
By then, I may have accumulated about a handful of things I want to discuss.

You could do something similar for your boss.
Say you have a bi-weekly meeting.
Create a task as you think of something, and once the meeting happens, pull up the tags, and you don't forget what to talk about.

## Create Recurring Tasks

Remember the grooming I mentioned above?
How do I not forget to do that?
There's a task that repeats every month.

Another example of a recurring task I have is on Monday morning to look at my week's schedule.

## Use Magic Text To Schedule

As I'm working on a Mac these days, I create most of my tasks with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-Command-A`.
When adding a task, I also immediately set a due date by just typing it and Todoist automagically recognizes it.

If you type a `#` into the field, a dropdown shows up with all projects.
I use this to quickly categorize a task.

## Use Templates For Recurring Projects

While a project in Todoist might not sound like something you'd do in your daily life, I have come to find them quite useful.
When I was living abroad from my home-country, I would regularly go back for a visit.
Here's my problem: I'm always terrified that I'm going to forget something.
So what I did with Todoist was create a project with all the things I needed to pack (one task per item).

Now, whenever I am about to travel, I copy the project and start ticking off tasks as I pack my backpack.

If I do forget something, I just make sure to add it to the original project (I call it the template), and next time I won't forget anymore.

## Use Todoist To Get Back Into Focus Mode

Sometimes I need to work on a mundane task and I have difficulty focusing.
When I become aware of that, I sometimes create a few tasks or subtasks in Todoist.
This way, I "gamify" my work and, by being able to tick off smaller things that lead to completing the entire task, I can better focus and get it done.

## Other Things I Use Todoist For

By now, you probably guessed that Todoist is pretty central in my life.

On my phone, there's a widget with the "Today" view for me to know what I planned on doing today.
Whenever I need to buy groceries, I create a new task "Buy". I then add all the items I plan on buying as subtasks.
Todoist is my calendar: I use it to remind myself of meetings with friends, or even their birthdays.
Last but not least, of course, there's a project called "Blob Posts to Write" where I collect ideas for things I might want to write about at some point.
