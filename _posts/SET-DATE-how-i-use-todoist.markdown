Earlier this year, after 3 years, 10 months, 2 weeks and three days after having created my [Todoist](https://todoist.com) account, I have reached the status Enlightened, which is the highest status you can get to in Todoist's gamification system.
According to Todoist, only 0.05% of their users reach this state.

I have been described as "productive" or "structured" by my peers. While I don't think I'm as "productive" or "structure" as some might think, I still believe todoist helps a lot with organizing everyday-tasks.

In this post, I'm going to describe how I use Todoist as well as some general tips on productivity.

# Writing Things Down Frees Your Mind

A few years ago, I read this book called [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done).
I don't remember much, but one thing stuck with me:
Imagine you need to mail an important letter tomorrow.
This might prevent you from falling asleep easily, because you keep thinking about what would happen if you forgot to mail it.

In these situations, I always add a task in todoist and set a reminder for when I need to do it.
This helps me free my mind and focus on something more important -- or nothing at all when I'd like to fall asleep.

# Stick with One Tool

Are you following [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)? [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)? 
There's a new tool for keeping tasks almost every day.
And there are people who keep trying them and blame the tool for why they're not happy about their productivity.

I am pretty sure the tool is most often not the problem.

I mean it's probably exciting to try something new, but you have to understand that switching the tool you're using comes with a cost as well.
And if your problem is not being able get tasks done, then the next tool will not help with that.

Todoist is pretty simple.
At least on the surface, it's really just a piece of software that lets you create a task and set a date.
You don't really need more, but what you do need is persistence:
Focus on using one tool and stick with it.
It might not be perfect, but the next one won't be perfect either and then you lost all the time switching.

# Grooming

Todoist comes with several views.
The one I use most often is "Today".
These are the tasks I want to finish today.
Another one is the "Inbox".
Those are the tasks without a date.

In terms of tasks that land in the Inbox, because they miss a date, I have decided for myself that that's a red flag.
There is no task that has no due date.
There might be a task, which is not that important, but even that task probably needs to be done by a certain date.

Therefore, about once per month I scroll through my Inbox and make sure every task has a date.
Sometimes, I would see a task where I actually forgot to set a date and I'd fix that.
However, what happens more often is that there are things in my Inbox which are not really tasks, but rather just some notes.
I move those to the respective project, but more on that below.

# Projects for Notes

I don't just use Todoist for things I need to do.
I also use it to collect articles I'd like to read, recipes I'd like to try, things I'd like to do, etc..

Most of these things, I have a feeling I never actually do.
But I believe it's great for productivity, because I often find myself scrolling through hackernews and finding all sorts of articles that are very interesting to read.
That is often procrastination though.
I have found that by storing those articles in Todoist and coming back to them when I actually have time, that fancy article about new technology xzy often doesn't seem all that appealing anymore.

- use todoist as a calendar
- use todoist for shopping
- use todoist with locations
- use tags for people
- do backlog grooming of your inbox
- make todoist a central point of your life (e.g. widget on a phone)
